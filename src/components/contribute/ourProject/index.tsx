        Dracula Theme is an open-source project driven by and for the community.
        Most apps that support the theme are contributions from our community.
      </p>
      <p>
        As much as the team responsible for the theme wants to support all
        available applications, we would need a lot of collaborators, which is
        currently unsustainable.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why you, a community member, are essential for this project to
        keep flying! Below are some guidelines, tips and specifications for you
        who want to apply the theme to any application.
      </p>
